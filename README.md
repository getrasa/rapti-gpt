## Introducing `RaptiGPT`
RaptiGPT makes it easier to find and manage information by letting you branch out to different conversations. Maintain several chats simultaneously, switch between them without confusion, and rapidly compare them side by side. It eliminates the need to have multiple tabs or cards open, making your information hunt less linear and more efficient.


# üî• Features

RaptiGPT comes with a bundle of amazing features! Here are some of them:
- Ability to open multiple windows side by side with customizable width and count.
- Seamless switch between GPT3.5 and GPT4 even after a conversation has begun.
- Profiles: System messages predefined and selectable for individual windows.
- An efficient File Importer: Automatically minifies imported code files to save space and provides simple file referencing with a single click.
- Integrated Multilingual Speech-to-Text function via Deepgram's implementation of WhisperAI (Key required).
